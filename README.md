# My Story
I was really active but since few months I have lost my touch on coding. So, I'm starting to work on my skills from scratch once again and I'll be posting everything here that I've just learned recently. I have started working on Data Structures and Algorithms already to brush up what I knew and now I have read from a lot of people about LeetCode like how good this platform is. So, this repository is going to be solely for LeetCode coding questions and yeah, let us see how well/worst I can do :)

# Top Interview Questions
I have recently started working on LeetCode and I have started with "Top Interview Questions" list. In this repository, I will be creating a separate file for each question and after the question desciption, you will find my solution there.

# Best of luck to me and to all others who are trying their best!!
